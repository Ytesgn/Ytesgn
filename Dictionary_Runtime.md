# Hypothesis

I predict that the multimap will be slower than the unordered multimap. This is due to the fact that the multimap has a balanced tree as the backend for the dictionary implementation, which is O(log(n)) insertion time. The unordered multimap has a hashtable as the backend for the dictionary implementation with O(1) runtime, so it should be factors faster than the multimap. I'm not sure what the factor is, but I will guess that the unordered multimap is at least 2 times faster than the multimap. In addition, I predict that it will take a while for the runtime of the unordered multimap to overtake the runtime of the multimap. This is because the two will have similar speed for smaller input sizes, but once the input size is big enough, the unordered multimap should be much faster. I think the multimap might be faster for smaller input sizes, but that is just a guess. 

# Methods

I started the process by creating two functions, one that would insert n elements into a multimap and another that would do the same thing for an unordered multimap. After that, I created a vector to store the input sizes that I was planning on testing. For the input sizes 10 and 100, I had to estimate their run times from the input size 10000. After the creation of the input sizes vector, I wrote a loop that would go through each input size and time how long it takes to insert the input size amount of elements into a multimap and an unordered multimap. After each of these times were calculated, I appened them to their respective vector that stored the runtimes for the multimap or the unordered multimap. For each iteration of the loop, I also reinstantiated both the multimap and the unordered  multimap, this way it was truly just an insertion of n elements starting from an empty dictionary. After all the times were calculated, I outputted them to the console alongside the input size that was passed to each dictionary implementation. The specifics of the input sizes I chose and other details are available in my code below.
